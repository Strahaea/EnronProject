This project hosts my notes for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course as well as my final project for it (located in the final project folder). The base code is provided by Udacity.

In these folders and for the project I make use of various Machine learning libraries(sci-kit learn, numpy, matplot) as well 
as techniques such as:
- feature selection, scaling, and pca
- regressions and outlier detection
- svms, decision trees, clustering
- use of training and testing sets

All the other folders are more or less complete but I am currently in the early stages of work on the final project. The goal of the final project is to apply machine learning techniques to the Enron Dataset: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Corpus to see if its possible to predict whether or not people were involved in the Enron fraud based on the data.
